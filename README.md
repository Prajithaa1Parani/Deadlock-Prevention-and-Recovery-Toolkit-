# Deadlock-Prevention-and-Recovery-Toolkit-
Create a toolkit that  detects, prevents, and  recovers from deadlocks  in real-time. The system  should implement  algorithms like Banker's  Algorithm and display  resource allocation  graphs for clarity.  Include a feature for  simulating deadlock  scenarios with custom  user inputs.
